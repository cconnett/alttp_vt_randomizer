	<div class="panel-body">
		<p>You'll need the base ROM. This should be a <span style="font-weight:bold;">Zelda no
			Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce v1.0</span> ROM. Don't worry if you can't read Japanese;
			the patching process provides English text while keeping the glitches unique to the
			original version intact.</p>

	<div class="panel-body">
				<p>Head on over to <a href="/randomizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generate Randomize Game</a> and provide your ROM. The next screen will show a variety of game options. For your first
			few runs, we recommend changing "Difficulty" to "Easy" and leaving the rest of the
			settings as is. Then click "Generate ROM" and you'll be given a newly minted
			randomized game!</p>
		<p>A more in-depth guide to all the available options can be found <a href="/options">here</a>.</p>

		<h3 class="panel-title">4. Get a Way to Play</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
		<p>First, you'll need something to run your newly minted game on. We recommend using an
			emulator. An emulator is a program that closely replicates SNES hardware, allowing you to
			run SNES games on your computer. You can get the recommended emulator, SNES9x, at their
			website <a href="http://www.snes9x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
		<p>While you can play using only your keyboard, a controller makes for a better experience.
			While most USB controllers will work, we recommend an
			<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B9XB0E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iBuffalo Classic USB
			Gamepad</a> or an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y0LUQFE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8Bitdo SFC30 Wireless Bluetooth Controller</a>.</p>
		<p>There are other supported ways to play, including on original SNES hardware. There are
			also certain emulators, such as zsnes, that won't work correctly with the randomizer.
			Join us on <a href="https://discord.gg/alttprandomizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> to learn more!</p>
		<p>NOTE FOR SNESMINI PLAYERS: Rename your ROM file to have 61 characters or fewer as the SNESMini can't handle long file names.</p>

	<div class="panel-body">
		<p>You're finally ready to go! The best way to learn is to load up your new ROM and start
			playing. If you feel like you're stuck, check out this list of common pitfalls, or ask
			on <a href="https://discord.gg/alttprandomizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You can use the Y button to swap between Silver Arrows and Normal Arrows, the Red
				and Blue Boomerangs, the Mushroom and the Magic Powder, and the Shovel and the
				Flute.</li>
			<li>You can save and quit with either the Frog or Purple Chest following you to bring
				it back to the light world without the Mirror.</li>
			<li>In the dark world, you can hookshot over the river north of the pyramid. Look for
				the arrow made out of grass!</li>
			<li>You can use the boots to dash into walls, blocks, and pots, knocking you backwards,
				in order to cross a gap.</li>
			<li>If you find yourself at bumper cave with the Cape but without the Hookshot, try
				walking over the top left of the gapâ€”no Hookshot needed!</li>
			<li>Keys might not be accessible if they are not required to finish the game. For instance, the Skull Woods big key might be in the big chest.</li>
		</ul>
