<h1>What is A Link to the Past: VT Randomizer?</h1>
<div class="well">
	<p>Venture back to Hyrule and an age of heroes, magic, and... shuffling with The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Randomizer!
		This time Ganon has shuffled all the items randomly throughout Hyrule so you'll need cunning, wit, and a little bit of luck
		luck to find the Bow atop Death Mountain, or the Fire Rod resting silently in the library, or even the Master Sword itself
		waiting in a chicken coup! Can you find everything you need to defeat Ganon? Time to find out!</p>
	<p>This was written and is maintained by Veetorp. A big thanks to Dessyreqt, ChristosOwen, Smallhacker, and Karkat
		for their work - without which none of this would have been even remotely possible!</p>
